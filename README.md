# Fall Detection Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a diverse and comprehensive dataset for fall detection research. Falls pose a significant risk to elderly individuals, patients with neurological disorders, and disabled children, necessitating the development of real-time intelligent fall detection (FD) systems. To address the limitations in existing approaches and facilitate advancements in the field, we have curated a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 10,500 samples with corresponding annotations.

## Dataset Details
- **Sample Size:** Approximately 10,500 samples
- **Annotations:** Each sample is annotated to denote instances of falls and non-falls.
- **Diversity:** The dataset encompasses diverse environmental conditions and scenarios, facilitating robust real-time processing.
- **Format:** The dataset is provided in a structured format to enable easy integration with popular machine learning frameworks.

## Usage
Researchers and practitioners interested in fall detection research can utilize this dataset for training, testing, and evaluating fall detection models. The dataset can be accessed via the following Google Drive link: [Fall Detection Dataset](#).

## Citation
If you use this dataset or our proposed approach in your research work, we kindly request you to cite the following paper:
